Attracting these types of critters will start to keep away the unwanted pests such as ticks and mosquitoes due to a prime food source and habitat provided for them. Moving waters create a background noise that is relaxing and will keep the water clean of pests and algae."

Giving a home for these species can separate them from critters who are also trying to use trees as homes. One of the most common habitats for birds, bats and owls are hollowed out trees which can be very vulnerable to storm damage and with that can be very dangerous not only to your family and home but dangerous to the animals. Giving them external home will let others know there is something using this space as a home which means it should not be altered as well as eliminating some of those dangers."
